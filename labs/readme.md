# Labs — Submission Guidelines

This folder holds your **lab work** for the course. Each lab should live in its own subfolder (e.g., `lab-01/`, `lab-02/`).

## Before you start
- **Read the lab document end-to-end.** Make sure you understand the goals, rubric, and required deliverables.
- Keep the **lab’s acceptance/deliverables list** handy while you work and verify each item before submitting.

## Folder layout (per lab)
Create a subfolder named with the lab key from the roadmap (e.g., `lab-01/`). Inside that folder include:
- Your **source files** for the lab.
- Any **assets** needed to run/review the work (images, styles, data, etc.).
- A brief **README.md**  with quick start notes and a screenshot (optional).

> If a specific entry file or structure is required (e.g., `index.html`, `main.py`), the lab document will say so—**follow that spec**.

## Submitting a lab
1. Put all lab files in `labs/<lab-key>/`.
2. Commit and push your changes.
3. Open the corresponding **lab issue** on your Project board and:
   - Check off the acceptance/deliverables items.
   - Add any notes or links requested by the lab document.
4. (If your lab asks for a link on your portfolio page) update the repo-root `index.html` with a link to this lab.

## Status & review
Use issue labels to show progress:
-  `ready-for-approval` → `completed`  

## Keep in mind
- **Match the lab key** (e.g., `lab-01`) exactly—this ties your folder and issue together.
- **Include every deliverable** listed in the lab document. If something is not applicable, note why in the issue.
- Write commit messages that describe what you changed; it helps reviewers follow your work.

If anything in your lab’s instructions conflicts with this page, **follow the lab document**—it is the source of truth for that assignment.
